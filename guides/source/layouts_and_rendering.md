Layouts and Rendering in Rails
==============================

This guide covers rendering and layout features of Action Controller and Action View.

After reading this guide, you will know:

* How the Controller interacts with the View to create a response.
* How to use rendering methods such as `render` and `redirect_to`.
* How to create layouts with multiple content sections.
* How Rails uses conventions to decide which layout to use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview: How the Pieces Fit Together
-------------------------------------

This guide focuses on the interaction between Controllers and Views in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. A Rails Controller is responsible for orchestrating the process of handling an HTTP request and composing a response. The Controller first hands off data access logic to the Model. Then, when it's time to send a response back to the browser, the Controller hands things off to the View. This guide will focus on the handoff between the Controller and the View.

The Controller to View interaction has two parts. First part involves the Controller deciding what type of response to send and using appropriate method to create that response. If the response is a full-blown view, it's wrapped in the correct layout and view partials are pulled in as well.

Rendering Views by Default
--------------------------

Controllers in Rails automatically render views with names that match controller action names that correspond to [CRUD verbs and routes](routing.html#crud-verbs-and-actions).

NOTE: Default rendering of views that match controller action names is an excellent example of the ["convention over configuration"](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#convention-over-configuration) technique that Rails promotes.

For example, if you have this code in your `BooksController` class:

```ruby
class BooksController < ApplicationController
end
```

And the following in your routes file:

```ruby
resources :books
```

And you have a view file `app/views/books/index.html.erb`:

```html+erb
<h1>Books are coming soon!</h1>
```

Rails will automatically render `app/views/books/index.html.erb` when you navigate to `/books` and you will see "Books are coming soon!" on your screen.

However, a coming soon screen is only minimally useful, so you will soon create your `Book` model and add the index action to `BooksController`:

```ruby
class BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @books = Book.all
  end
end
```

Note that we don't have explicit render at the end of the index action in accordance with "convention over configuration" principle. The rule is that if you do not explicitly render something at the end of a controller action, Rails will automatically look for the `action_name.html.erb` template in the controller's view path and render it. So in this case, Rails will render the `app/views/books/index.html.erb` file.

If we want to display the properties of all the books in our view, we can do so with an ERB template like this:

```html+erb
<h1>Listing Books</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Content</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @books.each do |book| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= book.title %></td>
        <td><%= book.content %></td>
        <td><%= link_to "Show", book %></td>
        <td><%= link_to "Edit", edit_book_path(book) %></td>
        <td><%= link_to "Destroy", book, data: { turbo_method: :delete, turbo_confirm: "Are you sure?" } %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

<%= link_to "New book", new_book_path %>
```

NOTE: The actual rendering is done by nested classes of the module [`ActionView::Template::Handlers`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Template/Handlers.html). This guide does not dig into that process, but it's important to know that the file extension on your view controls the choice of template handler.

todo: add transition - so the above is how rails renders responses implicitely. You don't even have to have a `render` statement in the Controller Action. when you need to be more elaborate with the type of responses you create as a result of the Controller action, you have 3 options below:

From the controller's point of view, there are three ways to create an HTTP response:

* Call [`render`][controller.render] to create a full response to send back to the browser. More in [this section](#creating-responses-using-render)
* Call [`redirect_to`][] to send an HTTP redirect status code to the browser. More in [this section](#creating-responses-using-redirect-to)
* Call [`head`][] to create an HTTP header only response.

[controller.render]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Rendering.html#method-i-render
[`redirect_to`]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Redirecting.html#method-i-redirect_to
[`head`]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Head.html#method-i-head

todo: link the difference between render and redirect_to sections.

Creating Responses Using `render`
---------------------------------

In most cases, the controller's [`render`][controller.render] method does the heavy lifting of rendering your application's content for use by a browser. There are a variety of ways to customize the behavior of `render`. You can render the default view for a Rails template, or a specific template, or a file, or inline code, or nothing at all. You can render text, JSON, or XML. You can specify the content type or HTTP status of the rendered response as well.

TIP: If you want to see the exact results of a call to `render` without needing to inspect it in a browser, you can call `render_to_string`. This method takes exactly the same options as `render`, but it returns a string instead of sending a response back to the browser.

### Rendering an Action's View

If you want to render the view that corresponds to a different template within the same controller, you can use `render` with the name of the view:

```ruby
def update
  @book = Book.find(params[:id])
  if @book.update(book_params)
    redirect_to(@book)
  else
    render "edit"
  end
end
```

If the call to `update` fails, calling the `update` action in this controller will render the `edit.html.erb` template belonging to the same controller.

If you prefer, you can use a symbol instead of a string to specify the action to render:

```ruby
def update
  @book = Book.find(params[:id])
  if @book.update(book_params)
    redirect_to(@book)
  else
    render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```

### Rendering an Action's Template from Another Controller

What if you want to render a template from an entirely different controller from the one that contains the action code? You can also do that with `render`, which accepts the full path (relative to `app/views`) of the template to render. For example, if you're running code in an `AdminProductsController` that lives in `app/controllers/admin`, you can render the results of an action to a template in `app/views/products` this way:

```ruby
render "products/show"
```

Rails knows that this view belongs to a different controller because of the embedded slash character in the string. If you want to be explicit, you can use the `:template` option (which was required on Rails 2.2 and earlier):

```ruby
render template: "products/show"
```

### Wrapping it up

The above two ways of rendering (rendering the template of another action in the same controller, and rendering the template of another action in a different controller) are actually variants of the same operation.

In fact, in the `BooksController` class, inside of the update action where we want to render the edit template if the book does not update successfully, all of the following render calls would all render the `edit.html.erb` template in the `views/books` directory:

```ruby
render :edit
render action: :edit
render "edit"
render action: "edit"
render "books/edit"
render template: "books/edit"
```

Which one you use is really a matter of style and convention, but the rule of thumb is to use the simplest one that makes sense for the code you are writing.

### Using `render` with `:inline`

The `render` method can do without a view completely, if you're willing to use the `:inline` option to supply ERB as part of the method call. This is perfectly valid:

```ruby
render inline: "<% products.each do |p| %><p><%= p.name %></p><% end %>"
```

WARNING: There is seldom any good reason to use this option. Mixing ERB into your controllers defeats the MVC orientation of Rails and will make it harder for other developers to follow the logic of your project. Use a separate erb view instead.

By default, inline rendering uses ERB. You can force it to use Builder instead with the `:type` option:

```ruby
render inline: "xml.p {'Horrid coding practice!'}", type: :builder
```

### Rendering Text

You can send plain text - with no markup at all - back to the browser by using
the `:plain` option to `render`:

```ruby
render plain: "OK"
```

TIP: Rendering pure text is most useful when you're responding to Ajax or web
service requests that are expecting something other than proper HTML.

NOTE: By default, if you use the `:plain` option, the text is rendered without
using the current layout. If you want Rails to put the text into the current
layout, you need to add the `layout: true` option and use the `.text.erb`
extension for the layout file.

### Rendering HTML

You can send an HTML string back to the browser by using the `:html` option to
`render`:

```ruby
render html: helpers.tag.strong('Not Found')
```

TIP: This is useful when you're rendering a small snippet of HTML code.
However, you might want to consider moving it to a template file if the markup
is complex.

NOTE: When using `html:` option, HTML entities will be escaped if the string is not composed with `html_safe`-aware APIs.

### Rendering JSON

JSON is a JavaScript data format used by many Ajax libraries. Rails has built-in support for converting objects to JSON and rendering that JSON back to the browser:

```ruby
render json: @product
```

TIP: You don't need to call `to_json` on the object that you want to render. If you use the `:json` option, `render` will automatically call `to_json` for you.

### Rendering XML

Rails also has built-in support for converting objects to XML and rendering that XML back to the caller:

```ruby
render xml: @product
```

TIP: You don't need to call `to_xml` on the object that you want to render. If you use the `:xml` option, `render` will automatically call `to_xml` for you.

### Rendering Vanilla JavaScript

Rails can render vanilla JavaScript:

```ruby
render js: "alert('Hello Rails');"
```

This will send the supplied string to the browser with a MIME type of `text/javascript`.

### Rendering Raw Body

You can send a raw content back to the browser, without setting any content
type, by using the `:body` option to `render`:

```ruby
render body: "raw"
```

TIP: This option should be used only if you don't care about the content type of
the response. Using `:plain` or `:html` might be more appropriate most of the
time.

NOTE: Unless overridden, your response returned from this render option will be
`text/plain`, as that is the default content type of Action Dispatch response.

### Rendering Raw File

Rails can render a raw file from an absolute path. This is useful for
conditionally rendering static files like error pages.

```ruby
render file: "#{Rails.root}/public/404.html", layout: false
```

This renders the raw file (it doesn't support ERB or other handlers). By
default it is rendered within the current layout.

WARNING: Using the `:file` option in combination with users input can lead to security problems
since an attacker could use this action to access security sensitive files in your file system.

TIP: `send_file` is often a faster and better option if a layout isn't required.

### Rendering Objects

Rails can render objects responding to `#render_in`. The format can be controlled by defining `#format` on the object.

```ruby
class Greeting
  def render_in(view_context)
    view_context.render html: "Hello, World"
  end

  def format
    :html
  end
end

render Greeting.new
# => "Hello World"
```

This calls `render_in` on the provided object with the current view context. You can also provide the object by using the `:renderable` option to `render`:

```ruby
render renderable: Greeting.new
# => "Hello World"
```

### Options for `render`

Calls to the [`render`][controller.render] method generally accept six options:

* `:content_type`
* `:layout`
* `:location`
* `:status`
* `:formats`
* `:variants`

#### The `:content_type` Option

By default, Rails will serve the results of a rendering operation with the MIME content-type of `text/html` (or `application/json` if you use the `:json` option, or `application/xml` for the `:xml` option.). There are times when you might like to change this, and you can do so by setting the `:content_type` option:

```ruby
render template: "feed", content_type: "application/rss"
```

#### The `:layout` Option

With most of the options to `render`, the rendered content is displayed as part of the current layout. You'll learn more about layouts and how to use them later in this guide.

You can use the `:layout` option to tell Rails to use a specific file as the layout for the current action:

```ruby
render layout: "special_layout"
```

You can also tell Rails to render with no layout at all:

```ruby
render layout: false
```

#### The `:location` Option

You can use the `:location` option to set the HTTP `Location` header:

```ruby
render xml: photo, location: photo_url(photo)
```

#### The `:status` Option

Rails will automatically generate a response with the correct HTTP status code (in most cases, this is `200 OK`). You can use the `:status` option to change this:

```ruby
render status: 500
render status: :forbidden
```

Rails understands both numeric status codes and the corresponding symbols shown below.

| Response Class      | HTTP Status Code | Symbol                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |

|                     | 511              | :network_authentication_required |

NOTE:  If you try to render content along with a non-content status code
(100-199, 204, 205, or 304), it will be dropped from the response.

#### The `:formats` Option

Rails uses the format specified in the request (or `:html` by default). You can
change this passing the `:formats` option with a symbol or an array:

```ruby
render formats: :xml
render formats: [:json, :xml]
```

If a template with the specified format does not exist an `ActionView::MissingTemplate` error is raised.

#### The `:variants` Option

This tells Rails to look for template variations of the same format.
You can specify a list of variants by passing the `:variants` option with a symbol or an array.

An example of use would be this.

```ruby
# called in HomeController#index
render variants: [:mobile, :desktop]
```

With this set of variants Rails will look for the following set of templates and use the first that exists.

- `app/views/home/index.html+mobile.erb`
- `app/views/home/index.html+desktop.erb`
- `app/views/home/index.html.erb`

If a template with the specified format does not exist an `ActionView::MissingTemplate` error is raised.

Instead of setting the variant on the render call you may also set it on the request object in your controller action.

```ruby
def index
  request.variant = determine_variant
end

private
  def determine_variant
    variant = nil
    # some code to determine the variant(s) to use
    variant = :mobile if session[:use_mobile]

    variant
  end
```

Creating Responses using `redirect_to`
-------------------------------------

Another way to handle returning responses to an HTTP request is with [`redirect_to`][]. As you've seen, `render` tells Rails which view (or other asset) to use in constructing a response. The `redirect_to` method does something completely different: it tells the browser to send a new request for a different URL. For example, you could redirect from wherever you are in your code to the index of photos in your application with this call:

```ruby
redirect_to photos_url
```

You can use [`redirect_back`][] to return the user to the page they just came from.
This location is pulled from the `HTTP_REFERER` header which is not guaranteed
to be set by the browser, so you must provide the `fallback_location`
to use in this case.

```ruby
redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)
```

NOTE: `redirect_to` and `redirect_back` do not halt and return immediately from method execution, but simply set HTTP responses. Statements occurring after them in a method will be executed. You can halt by an explicit `return` or some other halting mechanism, if needed.

[`redirect_back`]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Redirecting.html#method-i-redirect_back

### Getting a Different Redirect Status Code

Rails uses HTTP status code 302, a temporary redirect, when you call `redirect_to`. If you'd like to use a different status code, perhaps 301, a permanent redirect, you can use the `:status` option:

```ruby
redirect_to photos_path, status: 301
```

Just like the `:status` option for `render`, `:status` for `redirect_to` accepts both numeric and symbolic header designations.

The Difference Between `render` and `redirect_to`
------------------------------------------------

Sometimes inexperienced developers think of `redirect_to` as a sort of `goto`
command, moving execution from one place to another in your Rails code. This is
_not_ correct.

The current action will complete, returning a response to the browser. After
this your code stops running and waits for a new request, it just happens that
you've told the browser what request it should make next by sending back an
HTTP 302 status code.

Consider these actions to see the difference:

```ruby
def index
  @books = Book.all
end

def show
  @book = Book.find_by(id: params[:id])
  if @book.nil?
    render action: "index"
  end
end
```

With the code in this form, there will likely be a problem if the `@book` variable is `nil`. Remember, a `render :action` doesn't run any code in the target action, so nothing will set up the `@books` variable that the `index` view will probably require. One way to fix this is to redirect instead of rendering:

```ruby
def index
  @books = Book.all
end

def show
  @book = Book.find_by(id: params[:id])
  if @book.nil?
    redirect_to action: :index
  end
end
```

With this code, the browser will make a fresh request for the index page, the code in the `index` method will run, and all will be well.

The only downside to this code is that it requires a round trip to the browser: the browser requested the show action with `/books/1` and the controller finds that there are no books, so the controller sends out a 302 redirect response to the browser telling it to go to `/books/`, the browser complies and sends a new request back to the controller asking now for the `index` action, the controller then gets all the books in the database and renders the index template, sending it back down to the browser which then shows it on your screen.

While in a small application, this added latency might not be a problem, it is something to think about if response time is a concern. We can demonstrate one way to handle this with a contrived example:

```ruby
def index
  @books = Book.all
end

def show
  @book = Book.find_by(id: params[:id])
  if @book.nil?
    @books = Book.all
    flash.now[:alert] = "Your book was not found"
    render "index"
  end
end
```

This would detect that there are no books with the specified ID, populate the `@books` instance variable with all the books in the model, and then directly render the `index.html.erb` template, returning it to the browser with a flash alert message to tell the user what happened.

### Avoiding Double Render Errors

Sooner or later, most Rails developers will see the error message "Can only render or redirect once per action". While this is annoying, it's relatively easy to fix. Usually it happens because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the way that `render` works.

For example, here's some code that will trigger this error:

```ruby
def show
  @book = Book.find(params[:id])
  if @book.special?
    render action: "special_show"
  end
  render action: "regular_show"
end
```

If `@book.special?` evaluates to `true`, Rails will start the rendering process to dump the `@book` variable into the `special_show` view. But this will _not_ stop the rest of the code in the `show` action from running, and when Rails hits the end of the action, it will start to render the `regular_show` view - and throw an error. The solution is simple: make sure that you have only one call to `render` or `redirect` in a single code path. One thing that can help is `return`. Here's a patched version of the method:

```ruby
def show
  @book = Book.find(params[:id])
  if @book.special?
    render action: "special_show"
    return
  end
  render action: "regular_show"
end
```

Note that the implicit render done by ActionController detects if `render` has been called, so the following will work without errors:

```ruby
def show
  @book = Book.find(params[:id])
  if @book.special?
    render action: "special_show"
  end
end
```

This will render a book with `special?` set with the `special_show` template, while other books will render with the default `show` template.

Building Header-Only Responses Using `head`
------------------------------------------

The [`head`][] method can be used to send responses with only headers to the browser. The `head` method accepts a number or symbol (see [reference table](#the-status-option)) representing an HTTP status code. The options argument is interpreted as a hash of header names and values. For example, you can return only an error header:

```ruby
head :bad_request
```

This would produce the following header:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Connection: close
Date: Sun, 24 Jan 2010 12:15:53 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
X-Runtime: 0.013483
Set-Cookie: _blog_session=...snip...; path=/; HttpOnly
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

Or you can use other HTTP headers to convey other information:

```ruby
head :created, location: photo_path(@photo)
```

Which would produce:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Connection: close
Date: Sun, 24 Jan 2010 12:16:44 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Location: /photos/1
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
X-Runtime: 0.083496
Set-Cookie: _blog_session=...snip...; path=/; HttpOnly
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

Finding Layouts
---------------

To find the current layout, Rails first looks for a file in `app/views/layouts` with the same base name as the controller. For example, rendering actions from the `PhotosController` class will use `app/views/layouts/photos.html.erb` (or `app/views/layouts/photos.builder`). If there is no such controller-specific layout, Rails will use `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` or `app/views/layouts/application.builder`. If there is no `.erb` layout, Rails will use a `.builder` layout if one exists. Rails also provides several ways to more precisely assign specific layouts to individual controllers and actions.

### Specifying Layouts for Controllers

You can override the default layout conventions in your controllers by using the [`layout`][] declaration. For example:

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  layout "inventory"
  #...
end
```

With this declaration, all of the views rendered by the `ProductsController` will use `app/views/layouts/inventory.html.erb` as their layout.

To assign a specific layout for the entire application, use a `layout` declaration in your `ApplicationController` class:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  layout "main"
  #...
end
```

With this declaration, all of the views in the entire application will use `app/views/layouts/main.html.erb` for their layout.

[`layout`]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Layouts/ClassMethods.html#method-i-layout

### Choosing Layouts at Runtime

You can use a symbol to defer the choice of layout until a request is processed:

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  layout :products_layout

  def show
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  end

  private
    def products_layout
      @current_user.special? ? "special" : "products"
    end
end
```

Now, if the current user is a special user, they'll get a special layout when viewing a product.

You can even use an inline method, such as a Proc, to determine the layout. For example, if you pass a Proc object, the block you give the Proc will be given the `controller` instance, so the layout can be determined based on the current request:

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  layout Proc.new { |controller| controller.request.xhr? ? "popup" : "application" }
end
```

### Conditional Layouts

Layouts specified at the controller level support the `:only` and `:except` options. These options take either a method name, or an array of method names, corresponding to method names within the controller:

```ruby
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  layout "product", except: [:index, :rss]
end
```

With this declaration, the `product` layout would be used for everything but the `rss` and `index` methods.

### Layout Inheritance

Layout declarations cascade downward in the hierarchy, and more specific layout declarations always override more general ones. For example:

* `application_controller.rb`

    ```ruby
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      layout "main"
    end
    ```

* `articles_controller.rb`

    ```ruby
    class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
    end
    ```

* `special_articles_controller.rb`

    ```ruby
    class SpecialArticlesController < ArticlesController
      layout "special"
    end
    ```

* `old_articles_controller.rb`

    ```ruby
    class OldArticlesController < SpecialArticlesController
      layout false

      def show
        @article = Article.find(params[:id])
      end

      def index
        @old_articles = Article.older
        render layout: "old"
      end
      # ...
    end
    ```

In this application:

* In general, views will be rendered in the `main` layout
* `ArticlesController#index` will use the `main` layout
* `SpecialArticlesController#index` will use the `special` layout
* `OldArticlesController#show` will use no layout at all
* `OldArticlesController#index` will use the `old` layout

### Template Inheritance

Similar to the Layout Inheritance logic, if a template or partial is not found in the conventional path, the controller will look for a template or partial to render in its inheritance chain. For example:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/admin_controller.rb
class AdminController < ApplicationController
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb
class Admin::ProductsController < AdminController
  def index
  end
end
```

The lookup order for an `admin/products#index` action will be:

* `app/views/admin/products/`
* `app/views/admin/`
* `app/views/application/`

This makes `app/views/application/` a great place for your shared partials, which can then be rendered in your ERB as such:

```erb
<%# app/views/admin/products/index.html.erb %>
<%= render @products || "empty_list" %>

<%# app/views/application/_empty_list.html.erb %>
There are no items in this list <em>yet</em>.
```

Using Layouts to Wrap Views
---------------------------

When Rails renders a view as a response, it does so by combining the view with the current layout, using the rules for finding the current layout that were covered earlier in this guide. Within a layout, you have access to `yield` and [`content_for`][] for combining different bits of output to form the overall response.

Partials are also brought in during this response construction and wrapping process. Partials are covered in detail in the [Action View Guide]().

[`content_for`]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/CaptureHelper.html#method-i-content_for

### Understanding `yield`

Within the context of a layout, `yield` identifies a section where content from the view should be inserted. The simplest way to use this is to have a single `yield`, into which the entire contents of the view currently being rendered is inserted:

```html+erb
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can also create a layout with multiple yielding regions:

```html+erb
<html>
  <head>
  <%= yield :head %>
  </head>
  <body>
  <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

The main body of the view will always render into the unnamed `yield`. To render content into a named `yield`, you use the `content_for` method.

### Using the `content_for` Method

The [`content_for`][] method allows you to insert content into a named `yield` block in your layout. For example, this view would work with the layout that you just saw:

```html+erb
<% content_for :head do %>
  <title>A simple page</title>
<% end %>

<p>Hello, Rails!</p>
```

The result of rendering this page into the supplied layout would be this HTML:

```html+erb
<html>
  <head>
  <title>A simple page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>Hello, Rails!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `content_for` method is very helpful when your layout contains distinct regions such as sidebars and footers that should get their own blocks of content inserted. It's also useful for inserting tags that load page-specific JavaScript or CSS files into the header of an otherwise generic layout.

### Layouts for Partials

Partial templates - usually just called "partials" - are another device for breaking the rendering process into more manageable chunks. With a partial, you can move the code for rendering a particular piece of a response to its own file.

todo: keep stuff about "partial layouts" and "collection partial layouts" or link to Action View Overview guide

#### Partial Layouts

A partial can use its own layout file, just as a view can use a layout. For example, you might call a partial like this:

```erb
<%= render partial: "link_area", layout: "graybar" %>
```

This would look for a partial named `_link_area.html.erb` and render it using the layout `_graybar.html.erb`. Note that layouts for partials follow the same leading-underscore naming as regular partials, and are placed in the same folder with the partial that they belong to (not in the master `layouts` folder).

Also note that explicitly specifying `:partial` is required when passing additional options such as `:layout`.

### Using Nested Layouts

You may find that your application requires a layout that differs slightly from your regular application layout to support one particular controller. Rather than repeating the main layout and editing it, you can accomplish this by using nested layouts (sometimes called sub-templates). Here's an example:

Suppose you have the following `ApplicationController` layout:

* `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`

    ```html+erb
    <html>
    <head>
      <title><%= @page_title or "Page Title" %></title>
      <%= stylesheet_link_tag "layout" %>
      <style><%= yield :stylesheets %></style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="top_menu">Top menu items here</div>
      <div id="menu">Menu items here</div>
      <div id="content"><%= content_for?(:content) ? yield(:content) : yield %></div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

On pages generated by `NewsController`, you want to hide the top menu and add a right menu:

* `app/views/layouts/news.html.erb`

    ```html+erb
    <% content_for :stylesheets do %>
      #top_menu {display: none}
      #right_menu {float: right; background-color: yellow; color: black}
    <% end %>
    <% content_for :content do %>
      <div id="right_menu">Right menu items here</div>
      <%= content_for?(:news_content) ? yield(:news_content) : yield %>
    <% end %>
    <%= render template: "layouts/application" %>
    ```

That's it. The News views will use the new layout, hiding the top menu and adding a new right menu inside the "content" div.

There are several ways of getting similar results with different sub-templating schemes using this technique. Note that there is no limit in nesting levels. One can use the `ActionView::render` method via `render template: 'layouts/news'` to base a new layout on the News layout. If you are sure you will not subtemplate the `News` layout, you can replace the `content_for?(:news_content) ? yield(:news_content) : yield` with simply `yield`.
